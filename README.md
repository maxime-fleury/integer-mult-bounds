# A sharper exponent for integer multiplication

**Community research maintained by Douglas Colkitt — conditional on the original
OpenAI #109 framework.**

The reviewed community witness gives

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\boxed{\kappa=\frac{971668963}{25000000000000}
=3.886675852\times10^{-5}>2^{-15}}.
$$

This uses the fixed finite-alphabet Turing-machine model with a fixed number of
one-dimensional tapes in OpenAI's
[*Integer multiplication below n log n*](https://github.com/openai/math/tree/adc7f1241b42e322a6451854ab7e4b4c146bf78a/preprints/Integer-multiplication-below-n-log-n-September-23-2026).
The saving is approximately **27.36% above 2^-15**. These numbers compare
asymptotic exponent savings, not practical running times.

**Final contribution: [Rohan Arun (@rohanarun), PR #39](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/39).**
Rohan supplies the fixed-middle-basis composition, simultaneous-basis proof,
complete profile certificates and final integration, with substantial OpenAI
Codex assistance. This result builds on a substantial community dependency
chain, credited below and in the original source notices.

## What changed

The community work combines recursive batching and partial-swap frames with
semantic precision bounds, arbitrary-coordinate routing and bulk Gaussian
resampling. Two-stage circuits, paid copied-center operations and improved
contiguous blocks further strengthen the finite networks. The final PR fixes
one factor's basis and certifies its complete physical transition profile while
retaining a compatible generic basis for the other factor.

The selected bit network has m=575 and 188181929 roles. Its exact recursive
saving is 3886826921/10^14; the complex network supplies 717/10^7. The final
assembly retains all seven strict exponent margins, including numerical,
movement and normalization costs. See the [audit](docs/research/community-final-audit.md)
for the general arguments and their acceptance boundary.

  copied retained centers and the selected complex construction.
- **Zhihao Chen (@jacklightChen):** controlled bases, translated frames,
  semantic/bulk compatibility and two-stage integration.

  **Bortlesboat** and **dleen:** aligned pairing, retained totals and sharing.

The [full contribution record](CONTRIBUTORS.md) also credits parallel,
incremental, superseded and pending work, including princezuda's separate
Lean certificate submission. Inclusion there does not claim incorporation
or verification of every PR. Douglas Colkitt maintains the project and its
original research, review and integration, with OpenAI Codex assistance.

## Evidence and limits

The pinned contribution is PR #39 at `70ae24129649f6d6d4ec6360962a80c3c42a38f1`.
It has passed the maintainer's conditional mathematical audit. The original
#109 framework remains assumed; this is not full formal verification,
independent human peer review, or a claim of worldwide priority or optimality.
No complete practical multiplication-machine implementation is supplied.

Validation includes 218 tests, 20 historical patch checks, fresh finite
producers and profile certificates, Ubuntu/GCC reproduction and a three-version
Linux Python matrix. A separate arithmetic checker confirms the two recursive
moments and all seven margins without importing the candidate's checkers.
The [audit](docs/research/community-final-audit.md) separates that executable
evidence from the general proof arguments.

The former **2^-30 checkpoint** remains preserved at `1a74950`, with its
[proof note](artifacts/ternary-note.pdf), [certificate](certificates/ternary-side.json)
and [review guide](docs/research/ternary-review.md). Earlier artifacts are
historical witnesses, not descriptions of this release's construction.
PR #40 and later work remain outside the pinned audit.

### Open candidate, not part of this release

A checked follow-up in [research/ordered-chain](research/ordered-chain/README.md)
reorders the h=23 producer's sum aggregation (balanced halving to a single
sequential chain sorted by support size), lowering the matched carrier roles
`38,776 -> 37,620` and, on the recorded row, raising the conditional exponent to
`kappa = 982718877/25000000000000 = 3.930875508e-5` (**+1.137%**), still
`> 2^-15`. It is deliberately **not** wired into the headline above: the
reordered producer row is recorded from a local prototype rather than rebuilt by
the audited pipeline, so the producer/carrier-matching and physical-timeline
audits of a full release are still open. Its finite arithmetic and the pinned
tree are checked by `make ordered-chain-check`; the headroom analysis behind it
is in [docs/research/kappa-headroom.md](docs/research/kappa-headroom.md).

## Reproduce

Requires Python 3.11 or newer, Git, Make and a C++17 compiler with unsigned
128-bit integer support (tested with GCC and Clang). No third-party Python
packages or network access are needed for verification.

```sh
make verify
git diff --exit-code -- certificates patches
```

For the final witness and the independent arithmetic/source audit:

```sh
make copied-fixed-reversed-check
make copied-fixed-reversed-producer
make community-audit-check
make ordered-chain-check
```

Allow several minutes and multiple gigabytes of memory for full producer
rebuilds. See [reproduction details](docs/reproducibility.md).
